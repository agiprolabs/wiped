# Wiped System

This is the full boilerplate repo structure for the Wiped dual-action review remediation system.

## Structure
- `workflows/` - Contains each of the five major workflows with embedded specs
- `shared/` - Shared models, services, and utilities (to be created)
- `api/` - API integrations (Google, Certified Mail, FTC, etc.)
- `frontend/` - React components for each user role (to be created)
- `database/` - SQL schema and optional seed scripts

Each workflow is organized as an independent module for agentic scaffolding.
